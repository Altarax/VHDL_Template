# VHDL_Template
My VHDL template to start a project.

## My goal
I'm trying to create a reusable template for  
all of my VHDL projects. I start by creating  
two "main" files and I'll add everything I can  
to prepare my futur projects.  

Also, i'm using a bit of doxygen even if I won't  
necessarily use it for my personnal projects.
