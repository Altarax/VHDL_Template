# VHDL_Template
My VHDL template to start a project.

## My goal
I'm trying to create a reusable template for all of my VHDL projects. I start by creating  
two "main" files and I'll add everything I can to prepare my future projects.    

Also, i'm using a bit of doxygen even if I won't necessarily use it for my personnal projects.  

## Useful packages
I'll add every package I create that I find useful for future projects.
